# for PyElly 2.+

PyElly is an integrated toolkit of rule-based natural language processing capabilities
written in Python. This repository contains PyElly v2.*, which was created initially
by converting PyElly v1.6 from Python 2.7 code into Python 3.8 code. 

PyElly is aimed at students in high school who want to build class projects as a way
to gain firsthand experience with computation linguistics. It also may be of interest
to data scientists who need to dig deeper into their text data. The BSD licensing of
PyElly sets almost no restriction on what you can do with it.

The earlier pyelly GitHub repository https://github.com/prohippo/pyelly.git contains
the Python 2.7 code for PyElly v1.6.1.  This is provided for reference and for Python
users not yet migrated to Python 3.*. All further PyElly development will be for
PyElly 2.*.
